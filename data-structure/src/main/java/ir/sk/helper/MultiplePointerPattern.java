 * You can keep variables that point to different parts of an array.
 * Having multiple pointers helps to avoid O(nÂ²) time complexity if for example you wanted to calculate a target sum from a pair of numbers in a sorted array.
 * You can have a pointer at the beginning of the array and at the end of the array and you would move the pointers on every iteration. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n).
