/**
 * Can the vertices of a given graph be assigned
 * one of two colors in such a way that no edge connects vertices of the same color ?
 * which is equivalent to this question: Is the graph bipartite ?
 *
 * bipartite graph: A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices we can divide into two sets
 * such that all edges connect a vertex in one set with a vertex in the other set.
 * for example usage:
 * file consists of lines listing a movie name followed
 * by a list of the performers in the movie. In the
 * context of graph processing, we can view it as defining
 * a graph with movies and performers as vertices and
 * each line defining the adjacency list of edges connecting
 * each movie to its performers. Note that the graph
 * is a bipartite graphâ€”there are no edges connecting
 * performers to performers or movies to movies.
