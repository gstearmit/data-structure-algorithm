/**
 * a simple data type named Counter whose values are a name and a non

 * examine the current value. This abstraction is useful in many contexts. For example, it
 * would be reasonable to use such a data type in electronic voting software, to ensure that
 * the only thing that a voter can do is increment a chosen candidateâ€™s tally by one. Or,
 * we might use a Counter to keep track of fundamental operations when analyzing the
